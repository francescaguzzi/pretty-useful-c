# pretty-useful-c
A set of libraries that allow you to manipulate files, linked lists, sorting algorithms and much more. 
Made together with @Antonio-Rocchia, these libraries were originally made in order to pass the "Fondamenti
di informatica T-1" course exam in the computer engineering degree at UNIBO, but can be pretty useful for
anything else.
You're able to include a single library at once, but if you want to use them all you have to include only 
"list.h". Pay attention to the preprocessor!

Hope this can help. <3
